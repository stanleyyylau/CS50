## Intro to C

+ You write C in source
+ Then use a compiler to covert that source code into machine code(0s and 1s that your CUP can understand)
+ Use CS50 IDE and CS50 library
+ ``make`` is a utility program that trigger the C compiler

## Take away
+ ``int``  ``float`` computers cant represent some numbers precisely
+ All all your code has to go into the ``RAM`` that's like the ``working memory`` of your machine
+ 1 byte = 8 bit = 254
+ learn and understand ``overflow``
+ casting and type conversion

## Beautiful code and design principal
+ Refactor
+ Abstraction

## Compiling Steps
+ Preprocessing(including header files)
+ Compiling()
+ Assembling -- More readable language your CPU understands
+ Linking
